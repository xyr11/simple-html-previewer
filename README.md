# Simple HTML Previewer
literally made up of a \<textarea> that outputs stuff in an \<iframe>, how can you get more basic than this? oh yeah, you can also resize them, export as html, change themes, add indentation and more, and it also works in Internet Explorer 9 and later!

Current version: v1.0

## Installation
Download the repo by clicking [here](https://github.com/xyr11/simple-html-previewer/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or by presing the big green button that says 'Code' and choose 'Download ZIP'

(I'll probably add a release package in the future to make this easier)

## Usage
Open the `index.html` file or [visit the live version](https://xyr11.github.io/simple-html-previewer/)

## Known Issues
In Internet Explorer, `window.localStorage` doesn't fully work in local/offline versions of this project, and so your theme preferences and your code may not be saved if you close the page
