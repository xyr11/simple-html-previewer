# Simple HTML Live Preview

Literally an auto-updating \<iframe> only that gets input from a \<textarea>, there's not even an autosyntax and autocomplete feature. Why would you even use this? I mean the only neat thing in this is that it's lightweight, fully clientside only, and works in IE >=9

Current version: 0.4
